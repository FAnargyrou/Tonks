Developed with Unreal Engine 4.

## About

The idea of this project is to have a Local Hotseat Multiplayer experience that mimics the Worms Series whilst learning the ins and outs of the Engine.

I started my journey as a Game Developer back in Unreal Engine 3 (UDK). At the time, my knowledge was very limited and I could only do the very basic. I was 14 years old at the time.

10 years have passed and I've learnt a lot since then. Not only I was able to create a demo of a 2D game in C++ when I was in High School, I also secured myself a job as a C# Junior Developer. Now comes the real challenge: Create a 3D game from scratch and have something to be proud of.
